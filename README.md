# AirBoard
In this project you can draw anything on it by just capturing the motion of a colored marker with camera. Here a colored object at tip of finger is used as the marker. I have used the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to build this project. The preferred language is python due to its exhaustive libraries and easy to use syntax but understanding the basics it can be implemented in any OpenCV supported language.
Here Color Detection and tracking is used in order to achieve the objective. The color marker in detected and a mask is produced.
